Certainly, creating a README is crucial for explaining the purpose of your project, how to set it up, and how to use it. Below is a template for your README file. You should tailor it to fit more specific information about your project.

# Diabetes Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors

This project aims to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. We employ the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful machine learning technique used for classification tasks.

## Project Overview

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset from an Excel file and perform necessary preprocessing steps like scaling the features and encoding the target labels.
   
2. **Model Training**: Utilize the k-NN algorithm to train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on both the training and test sets to ensure it's neither overfitting nor underfitting. Visualize the accuracy of the model across different k values.

4. **Single Prediction**: Demonstrate how to use the trained model to make a prediction on new, unseen data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Python 3.7+.
- You have a `<Windows/Linux/Mac>` machine. State which OS is supported/which is not.
- You have installed the required Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.
